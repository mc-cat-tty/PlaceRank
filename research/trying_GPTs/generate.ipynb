It is a way of interpreting reality and how the brain perceives and understands that reality: It doesn't just show you numbers when you say \"you are the center\", the brain also tells you how much happiness, sadness and pain you feel. It tells you how much people are good to have around you (\"you have a friend today\"), how much it bothers you to be alone (you can imagine how much you loathe your friends) in relationships (some of my personal favorites are \"I have a great relationship and my partner loves me all the time.
